## Homework 1
### Technical Task : 
- Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red,
Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically,
you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a
mapped value to the LED pins.

### Components :
- RGB LED (At least 1)
- Potentiometers (At least 3)
- Resistors and wires as needed
